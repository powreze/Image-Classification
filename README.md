# Image-Classification
 rock-paper-scissors classification

Image classification with Model Sequential using Tensorflow and Keras Library in Google Colabs. This task aims to classify the image based on the format (rock / paper / scissors).

- Dataset
- The dataset included 2.188 images (rock-paper-scissors), within 726 rock images, 712 paper images, and 750 scissors images
- Separate the dataset into 2 parts
	1. train data 80%
	2. validation 20%
- Use Tensorflow, numpy, and matplotlib to support the process
- Process image augmentation to create a new data image based on the format been used
- Use Image Data Generator
- Training data use Sequential model
- Try to visualize it towards the accuracy and the loss
- level of accuracy should be > 90% 

Files included
- Code -> Python file (img.py)
- result -> Google colab notebook (gcolab.ipyb)

Tools Used
- Google Colab notebook for presentational purposes
- Visual Studio Code
